    "\n",
    "In the case of estimating a sample mean $\\hat{\\mu}$ from a number of points $n$, we get that the $Var(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$ where $\\sigma$ is the standard distribution of the original set of $n$ points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of this value is called the **standard error** and gives us a rough idea of how much the estimator will change from sample to sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the standard error is large and the estimated value small then the estimator might not be significantly different than 0, meaning it statistically is insignificant. To test significance a hypothesis test can be done on any of the predictors. The hypothesis test is usually done to test whether the predictor is different than 0. \n",

We know beforehand that each variable has a positive relationship with y and in the first model, x1 is positive and x2 is negative which is an impossibility.
